I would like to recommend an ACM membership with Skills Bundle. This gives an access to O'Reilly, Skillsoft Percipio and Pluralsight. The 2024 cost 2024 is $174 per year or $100 if you are from developing countries. 

This cost is quite high but still way better than O'Reilly access alone which is $499 yearly. Pluralsight (also $499 yearly standard price) gives an access to huge library of video courses which are useful for certificate preparation. 

The Oâ€™Reilly library is enormous. It is more than 60.000 titles, there are also audiobooks and videos. It contains titles of other publishers such as Manning or No Starch Press.

To sum up, I can highly recommend [joining ACM](https://www.acm.org/membership/join) if you are interested in lifelong learning.
