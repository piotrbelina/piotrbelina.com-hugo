Recently I saw a video by Tiago Forte which seemed to me very interesting about taking book notes. It is an interview with Alex Wieckowski from [Alex & Books](https://alexandbooks.com/start-here) in which he describes his method to get the most out of the book.

## TLDR
1. Highlight the most interesting parts inside the book.
2. Create your own table of contents at the first page of the book.
3. Write down summary of the book in your own words at the last page of the book.
